# Shadow Fox Internship â€” Task 2
*Sentiment Analysis of X (Twitter) Data*
This project analyzes tweet sentiments to uncover public opinion trends on X. Tweets are categorized as positive, negative, or neutral using natural language processing techniques. A logistic regression model was trained on labeled data and achieved an accuracy of 75.4%, with strong performance across all sentiment classes.
#  Folder Structure
- `data/`  
  Contains the labeled tweet dataset (`tweets.csv`) used for training and evaluation.
- `notebook/`  
  Includes the Jupyter Notebook (`sentiment_analysis_x.ipynb`) and this README.
- `images/`  
  Stores visual outputs such as classification reports, confusion matrix, and sentiment trend plots.
# Key Objectives
- Classify tweets into positive, neutral, or negative sentiment
- Explore sentiment distribution and trends over time
- Evaluate model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score
# Techniques Used
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal)
- Sentiment classification using Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation with scikit-learn metrics
- Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn
# Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
